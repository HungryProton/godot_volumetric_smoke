# Volumetric Smoke

A tiny experiment to loosely emulate the volumetric smoke for Counter Strike 2 in Godot.

# Warnings

Keep in mind this is just something I toyed with for 3 hours for fun and is not something I'm actively maintaining.
Unlike CS2, this is not using a grid of voxels, but "loose voxels" that can occupy any position in space.
It is subject to leaks in its current state!

This project is:
+ NOT optimized at all.
+ NOT a drop in solution that 'just work'.

Feel free to play around and tinker with it though!
